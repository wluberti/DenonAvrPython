# DenonAvr

A small Python script to control a Denon Audio/Video Receiver. In my case I tested this on a Denon AVX-4000 but it should work on many Denon / Marantz receivers that have network (telnet) capability. Just make sure to enable it in the webgui.

# To-do
- Be able to read from the interface to identify current state
- Implement more available features
